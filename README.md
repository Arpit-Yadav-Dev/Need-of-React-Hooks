# React Learning Project - Need of React Hooks

Welcome to my React Learning Project - "Need of React Hooks"! This project was created to explore and understand the fundamental concepts of React hooks.

## Overview

This project serves as a practical exploration of React hooks and their applications. Throughout its development, I delved into various concepts, including prop drilling solutions, useContext for state management, and the implementation of a simplified Redux pattern using custom hooks, context, and reducers.

## Features Explored

- **Prop Drilling Mitigation:** Demonstrates how to address prop drilling issues using the useContext.
- **Custom Hook for State Management:** Utilizes custom hooks to mimic a simplified Redux pattern for state management.
- **UseRef for DOM Manipulation:** Shows how to use useRef to interact with DOM elements in React.
- **Higher Order Functions:** Implements higher order functions for passing props not only from parent to child but also from child to parent.
- **Recursion Optimization:** Uses useMemo and useCallback to optimize a recursive function (Fibonacci series) and prevent performance issues.

## Project Structure

  - `/src`: Contains the main source code.
  - `/components`: React components used in the project.
  - `/hooks`: Custom hooks for state management.
  - `/context`: All context including theme also.
  - `/data`: Initial data file .

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arpit-Yadav-Dev/Need-of-React-Hooks.git
cd Need-of-React-Hooks
npm install
npm start
